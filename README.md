#  VANquish Collisions Hackathon
Made for 24 hours in VANquish Collisions Hackathon in 2018. There are still some problems in this game, but I might fix it after the Hackathon. 

## The purpose of this application
To reduce the number of seniors in traffic fatalrties with fun. I teamed up with one designer and 2 Front End developers. 
[The game is in here.](http://www.safecrossing.club/game/)

### What I used
Javascript, p5.js, jQuery, HTML, CSS
